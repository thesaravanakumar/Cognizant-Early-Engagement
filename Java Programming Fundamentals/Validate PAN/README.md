# Validate PAN

Write a program to check  the  PAN card no is valid or not. Generally a PAN no is a mix of both numbers and alphabets. It should have exactly 10 characters, in which, the first 5 characters should be upper case, the next 4 should be numbers, and last one should be an upper case character. If the PAN no doesn't match the pattern print "Invalid PAN no".
