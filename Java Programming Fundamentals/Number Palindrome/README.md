# Number Palindrome

George and  Tintin plays  by  telling numbers.  George says a number to Tintin.  Tintin should first reverse the number and check if it is same as the original.  If yes,  Tintin should say “Palindrome”.  If not, he should say “Not a Palindrome”.  If the number is negative, print “Invalid Input”.  Help Tintin by writing a program.
